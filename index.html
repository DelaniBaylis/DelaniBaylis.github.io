<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Hello My Name is Delanin Baylis, and I am attending the Southern New Hamshire University's Computer Science
   Program. This is me making a GitHub Pages, program on what I have learned thoughout my time in SNHU. Also,
   how I am able to use what I learned.</p>

<h2 id="education-review"><strong>Education Review</strong></h2>
<p>So completeing my coursework was really easy, but was also a lot of fun as well, going back
    to the basic's and trying to see what we learned. I loved rewriting the old codes that I used to show 
    that I have gotten a better understanding about coding, and what the purpose of coding is. The files that I 
    rewrote where all about the subjects around CS 320. The database that I used was a cloud database. I enchanced these files
    to show what I knew all the subjects that I was asked around.I would say that thanks to my teachers, 
    I had a really big understanding of what was expect of me in this class.</p>

<h2 id="artifacts"><strong>Artifacts</strong></h2>
<p>The artifacts that I chose where all based around my class CS 320. I felt that this was the best class
    that showed everything that was nedd for this assignment. The class was also a good and basic way to start
    when it comes to coding.</p>

<h1 id="code-review"><strong>Code Review</strong></h1>

<h1 id="enchancement-one-software-design-and-engineering"><strong>Software Design/Engineering</strong></h1>
<p>The artifact that I chose for the software design is my CS 320 project based around the files in the Appointment project, 
   which was created around February 2023. The premise of the program is to help out with hospitals, and their patience, in how they are going to be 
   making appointments. The all in all goals of CS 320 was to show the class how the junit system is used in coding, and how it processed code that worked, 
   and didn’t work.</p>

<p>The reason I chose this item was that it was a really good way to show how a basic software application takes that data that it is given, and how it is 
   in the end processed. What junit is, is that it is more for the programmers private test to make sure that everything is running, so that when they can 
   give the code off, the system has as little errors as possible.</p>

<p>What I did is that I changed the code to show what would happen if a patient was to schedule an appointment with the place, and how the outcome would be 
   if you didn’t schedule any appointment. The original mostly focuses on just making the code, and giving the layout of the code. The enhanced version gives 
   the code a more real see, of how the code is supposed to work.</p>

<p>For this part of the artifact the code works great. It can run in junit, and works well in the end.</p>

<h1 id="enhancement-two-algorithms-and-data-structures"><strong>Algorithms and Data Structures</strong></h1>
<p>The artifact that I chose to use was CS 320 again, and the project that I chose this time was the 
   Contact Assignment that was made around February 2023. It is a test module that helps a system with 
   the contact list, and how people are supposed to put in their contact information.</p>

<p>The reason I chose this artifact was that it is a good example of how little changes in the code algorithm, 
   and data structure can change how everything in the test module looks different. One of the things that I 
   showed is that in the original code it shows that old and outdated code that needed to be refined. What I 
   do is refine that code making it more simple, and easier to follow. What I am trying to show is that the old 
   code needed to be updated, to the newer one, because the old data structure could be simplified down, so if 
   anyone else wanted to work on the code, they could share it with their team.</p>

<p>Yes I would say that I met my goal that I set out to show. What you may ask is that, I wanted to show how you 
   can simplify an old code down, to make it easier to work with in the long run. The reason why this matters is 
   that if you are on a team it can help your team members know what the problem is, and where they can find those 
   problems.</p>

<h1 id="enhancement-three-databases"><strong>Databases</strong></h1>

<p>The artifact that I used for this is CS 320 Task assignment, that was made around 2020. What this file contains 
   is that it contains a file that has a task that people will follow, and how the task is assigned to in the file 
   that is in the cloud database, which means it's public and everyone can see it. The pre-enhancement is the file 
   using the task system will use hash tables for the task. The post-enhancement is the files being used without the 
   hash tables, and also simplifying the whole thing.</p>

<p>The project that I chose was one of the biggest examples of the cloud database, and the reason why some of the 
   other databases can be better. The language that is used inside the database is java. What the cloud database helps 
   with is the fact that it is open, and can be used by multiple people, and shared without reason, and edited with 
   no problem. I show this in the enhanced version of this project. Whereas some databases are more secure, the openness 
   of a cloud database can help a lot. The cons that come with it is security as well, since the database is not that 
   secure it is really easy to change, unless there is a secure key on the files.</p>

<p>To me I feel like I did complete all the things that I wanted to show in this artifact about databases. 
   I wanted to show what is the big thing that makes using a cloud database good, and what are the flaws of using 
   a cloud database.</p>

<p>When I was making my changes I learned a lot of how cloud databases work. Since the files are saved in my cloud 
   databases, I was able to just log in anywhere and make the necessary edits anywhere, showing how versatile a cloud 
   database can be. I also learned that making these enchantments to the file made me see that codes can always be simplified 
   down, to make it easier to edit later.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>

<p>This is what I learned in my years of taking computer science, it was a really grueling, but fun experience.
   Would I take this subject again, if I where to forget everything, the answer to that question is yes,
   the reason being that I loved everything that I learned, even the difficult subjects, that is why I say yes
   to that answer.</p>
